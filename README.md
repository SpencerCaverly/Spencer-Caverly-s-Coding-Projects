High-Resolution Photocurrent and Raman Spectroscopy Mapping Tool


This project involves the development of a Python-based data analysis tool originally created at Sandia National Laboratories. The software is designed to map high-resolution photocurrent data and superimpose it onto Raman Spectroscopy maps, enabling the creation of detailed 2D visualizations that reveal interactions between the two datasets across micro and nanoelectronic devices.


Features


Photocurrent Data Mapping: High-resolution analysis and mapping of photocurrent data.

Raman Spectroscopy Integration: Superimposition of Raman Spectroscopy maps for a comprehensive view of data interactions.

2D Visualization: Produces clear and detailed 2D representations that capture intricate details across devices.

Adaptability: The Python script is designed to be flexible, with the ability to support a wide variety of microelectronics and nanoelectronics applications.

User-Friendly: Easily executable script that can be integrated into various experimental workflows.


Applications


This tool can be applied across multiple research domains, including:

Microelectronics: Detailed analysis of current distribution across devices.

Nanoelectronics: Fine-resolution mapping for nanoscale applications.

Material Science: Combining electrical and spectroscopic data for advanced material characterization.
